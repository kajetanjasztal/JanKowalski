Single-page website in html+css

## Origin

This project was inspired by the [John Doe](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe)
(by [@cadars](https://github.com/cadars)). It's a single-page website, with
multiple "sub-pages" achieved using only html and css.

Design was modified in a few ways, breaking some things and simplifying others.
I've done it as a fun exercise and I don't intend to polish it in any way
_(maybe if it simplifies it further)_.

If you find it interesting as I do fill free to play with it in any way you
like.

It's just a fun toy, I don't encourage using it or any patterns/concepts
included.
